/**
 * Interface ExecutorInterface can be implemented by a View that can be displayed on a page or in a modal window
 * and it would have an interaction with the user before invoking Action's callback.
 *
 * SomeExecutor::addTo($app)->setAction($model, 'action_name');
 *
 * Here are some suggested implementation for ExecutorInterface:
 *
 *  - MarkdownPreview. Requires $preview callback to be defined by the action. Will treat output as Markdown. Confirm button will
 *      execute action normally.
 *
 *
 *  - ArgumentForm. Displays a form which is populated with arguments. When submitting the form, action will be executed.
 *
 *  - ArgumentForm\Preview. extends Argument form by adding a "Preview" area to the right of the form. By default will
 *      treat $preview as text, but can also use a more specific view, such as a Pie Chart
